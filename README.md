Installation
------------

1. Download the latest packaged version of the module from the [releases](https://github.com/bitcoinpay/bitcoinpay-prestashop/releases) page.
2. Upload the module package directly to your PrestaShop site (via **Modules > Add a new module**), then click `Install` on the BitcoinPay module in the module list. You might see a pop-up informing you about the risks of unverified modules. It is safe to click `Proceed`.
3. On the BitcoinPay settings page that comes up after installing it, you will need to fill in the relevant details according to your BitcoinPay account. There is help text underneath each field to guide you.
4. Once you've clicked `Save`, the module will automatically verify that the details are correct. If there are any problems with the values you've entered, you will see an appropriate error message. If the module settings save successfully then your details are correct and your BitcoinPay account has been successfully linked to your PrestaShop site.
5. The last thing you need to do is go to **Modules > Payment** in your PrestaShop back-office and make sure you have all of the relevant currencies enabled for the BitcoinPay payment module under the **Currency Restrictions** panel.
6. That's it. Your customers will now see a "Pay with Bitcoin" payment method on your site's checkout page and be able to seamlessly pay for their orders with Bitcoin!
